#keywords; datatypes; Operators; logical skills are the four basic pillars of a programming langguage 
#keyword: helps us in building code examples: and true false if else and import

name = "gangadhar" # any object defining with double quote are string; with out doublequote and = operator it is called as variable

#in python no need to declare datatype-variable this type is called Dynamically typed programing language ; go lang,java are Statastical programing language

print("project_T")#without variable

ec2_instance_name = "project_T"#using variable ; with the help of variables we can avoid hard coding 
print(ec2_instance_name)
 
#variables are of two types global variables and loacal variables
#when variables are declared aat the initial stage or before the function(def) those are called global ; when those are declared with in the function(def) stage they are called local variables

#naming convention of variables (or) thumb rules for declaring variables
# a)allways declare variables in lower case;
# b)use "_" underscore to declare two words which is called snake casing;
# c)camel casing = declaring first letter capital at starting of each word "ec2InstanceName"
# d)declare variable fully.
